          Difference between var, let, and const keyword in JavaScript .
        </h1>
        <p class="text-2xl font-semibold">
          Scope essentially means where these variables are available for use.
          In JavaScript, the scope of variables declared with
          <span class="font-bold text-3xl">var, let,</span> and
          <span class="font-bold text-3xl">Const</span> differs based on their
          declaration.
        </p>
        <div class="py-10">
          <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-5">Var</h2>
          <p class="text-2xl">
            Variables declared with
            <span class="font-bold">var</span> are in the function scope. When
            <span class="font-bold">var</span> variable declared out of the
            function is called global scope. This means that it is available and
            can be accessed only within that function.
          </p>
          <p class="text-2xl py-5">
            <span class="font-bold">var</span> variables can be re-declared and
            updated. This means that we can do this within the same scope and
            won't get an error.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="py-10">
          <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-5">Let</h2>
          <p class="text-2xl">
            Variables declared as <span class="font-bold">let</span> are in the
            block scope. So a variable declared in a block with
            <span class="font-bold">let</span> is only available for use within
            that block. It's no surprise as it comes as an improvement to var
            declarations.
            <span class="font-semibold"
              >let is now preferred for variable declaration.</span
            >
          </p>
          <p class="text-2xl py-5">
            <span class="font-bold">let</span> can be updated but not
            re-declared. Just like var, a variable declared with let can be
            updated within its scope.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="py-10">
          <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-5">Const</h2>
          <p class="text-2xl">
            Variables declared as <span class="font-bold">Const</span> are in
            the block scope. Like
            <span class="font-bold">let</span> declarations,
            <span class="font-bold">Const</span> declarations can only be
            accessed within the block they were declared.
          </p>
          <p class="text-2xl py-5">
            Main concept of const variable is
            <span class="font-bold">const</span> cannot be updated or
            re-declared This means that the value of a variable declared with
            <span class="font-bold">const</span> remains the same within its
            scope. It cannot be updated or re-declared. So if we declare a
            variable with const

        </h1>
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-5">Null</h2>
        <p class="text-2xl mb-10">
          <span class="font-bold">Null</span> in JavaScript means an empty value
          and is also a primitive type in JavaScript. The variable which has
          been assigned as <span class="font-bold">null</span> contains no
          value.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-5">Undefined</h2>
        <p class="text-2xl">
          <span class="font-bold">undefined,</span> in javascript means the
          variable has been declared, but its value has not been assigned.

          What is a REST API?
        </h1>
        <p class="text-2xl">
          An API, or application programming interface, is a set of rules that
          define how applications or devices can connect to and communicate with
          each other. A REST API is an API that conforms to the design
          principles of the REST, or representational state transfer
          architectural style. For this reason, REST APIs are sometimes referred
          to RESTful APIs.
